# ðŸŽµ Concert Scraper with Selenium

- Automatically opens each artistâ€™s concert page on ConcertArchives.org.
- Scrapes upcoming concert data including:
  - Date
  - Concert Name & Link
  - Venue
  - City, State, Country
- Saves the collected data into a `Output.csv` file.
- Supports batch processing for multiple artists (first 200 by default).

- The following Python packages:
